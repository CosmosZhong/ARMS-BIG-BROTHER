All assembly files in this directory require the following format. Otherwise, the 'asm_reference_simulator.sh' 
might produce an invalid reference output for them.

Format requirements:

- Must load the final value into register $v0
- All instructions should contribute somehow to correct state of the final value that will be stored in $v0
- A failing instruction should lead to an incorrect final value ($v0)

See 'addiu_1.asm' as an example of a valid assembly file.
